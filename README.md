# Stonewall-Inn---Automarker-file

Stonewall Inns adjusted automarker file

Kill Order: Skull --> Cross --> Square

- MC adjusted targets for Kill order and Banish targets (Diamond/Triangle)
- AQ40 adjusted for assignment sheet to not confuse raiders with the Kill order when they fight Anubis Guardians at the start
- BWL adjusted for the packs after Vaelstraz: Moon and Diamond sleep (if possible)
- ES is tricky, since it has random generated enemy grps, but tried to respect the kill order
- Naxx to reflect the assignment sheet
